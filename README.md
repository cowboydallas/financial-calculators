One piece of code I found interesting was `double equation = depositAmt * Math.pow(1 + rateOfInterest / 365, 365 * numberOfYears);`. I found this interesting because including mathematical equations into code was very confusing to me but with a little bit of comprehension I was able to figure it out and now it makes complete sense on how to format it into code.
